# Flood fill Algorithm â€“ how to implement fill() in paint?

In MS-Paint, when we take the brush to a pixel and click, the color of the region of that pixel is replaced with a new selected color. Following is the problem statement to do this task.
Given a 2D screen, location of a pixel in the screen and a color, replace color of the given pixel and all adjacent same colored pixels with the given color.

Example 1:

```txt
Input:
screen[M][N] = {
    {1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1},
    {1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0},
    {1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1},
    {1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 1, 0},
    {1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 0, 1, 0},
    {1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0},
    {1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1},
    {1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1}
};
x = 4, y = 4, newColor = 3
The values in the given 2D screen indicate colors of the pixels.
x and y are coordinates of the brush, newColor is the color that should replace the previous color on screen[x][y] and all surrounding pixels with same color.

Output:Screen should be changed to following.
screen[M][N] = {
    {1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1},
    {1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0},
    {1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1},
    {1, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 1, 0},
    {1, 1, 1, 3, 3, 0, 1, 0},
    {1, 1, 1, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0},
    {1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1},
    {1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 3, 1},
};
```


### My Approach 1
Check neighbour left, right,top,bottom if any of these are valid (i.e same color at touched Point prevVal), then these become the border points.
For each border point, move in all 4 directions and check as above. All valid points become part of new border points.
Easily done with recursive until border points are empty or touched boundaries.
Make sure when new border point found, change its color, to avoid infinite loop or circular loop.
