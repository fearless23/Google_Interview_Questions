# Generate all binary strings from given pattern

Given a string containing of `0`, `1` and `?` (wildcard character), generate all binary strings that can be formed by replacing each `?` by `0` or `1`.

[Solution](./q2.js)

Example 1:

```
Input str = "1??0?101"
Output: 10000101
        10001101
        10100101
        10101101
        11000101
        11001101
        11100101
        11101101
```

### My Approach 1

1. Split the input string, replace

- `?` with `["0","1"]`
- `0` with `["0"]`
- `1` with `["1"]`

2. ombine array of arrays recursively

### My Approach 2

1. Keep a results array starting with first char of input string.
2. Loop over chars of input string,
   - if char is `?`, add `0` and `1` to all items in results array.
   - if char is not `?`, add that char to all items in results array.

### My Approach 3

1. Same as Approach 2
2. When char is not `?`, we check rest of chars until we found another `?` in the string. Now, we add combined string.

Note: If pattern is `...?010011?...`, approach 3 will have lesser loops to run, because we add `010011` once(Loops = `PatternLength`+`resultsArrayLength`), but in approach 2 we will add each num in `010011` one by one to results array(Loops: `PatternLength`\*`ResultsArrayLength`).

For Pattern Length = 1, i.e `...?1?...`, approach 2 has lesser loops.

Depending upon which patterns dominate in input string, approach 2 and approach 3 has different loops. In general however approach 3 is better.

### My Approach 4

Using higher order array functions.
