# Count of strings that can be formed using a, b and c under given constraints

Given a length n, count the number of strings of length n that can be
made using ‘a’, ‘b’ and ‘c’ with at-most one ‘b’ and two ‘c’s allowed.

Input : n = 3
Output : 19
Below strings follow given constraints:
aaa aab aac aba abc aca acb acc baa
bac bca bcc caa cab cac cba cbc cca ccb

Input : n = 4
Output : 39

# My Approach 1

For any n
All a`s = 1
1b rest a = n
1c rest a = n
1b,1c rest a = n(n-1)
2c res a = n(n-1)/2
2c, 1b rest a = n(n-1)(n-2)/2

Total = 1 + n + n + 3/2*n*(n-1)+ n(n-1)(n-2)/2
Time Complexity: O(1)
