# Find subarray with given sum | Set 1 (Nonnegative Numbers)

Given an unsorted array of nonnegative integers,
find a continuous subarray which adds to a given number.

Examples :

```
Input: arr[] = {1, 4, 20, 3, 10, 5}, reqSum = 33
Ouptut: Sum found between indexes 2 and 4
```

```txt
Input: arr[] = {1, 4, 0, 0, 3, 10, 5}, sum = 7
Ouptut: Sum found between indexes 1 and 4
```

```txt
Input: arr[] = {1, 4}, sum = 0
Output: No subarray found
```

## My Approach 1

start from idx 0: keep adding nums until

1. end of list or
2. sum > reqSum

repeat with idx 1 and so on...

i.e nested loop of `0<i<N` and `i+1<j<N`

## Approach 2: Online From Geeks for Geeks
Instead of looping over i`th idx and then rest
We focus on 2 items at once, if sum exceeds we remove first and add next.
