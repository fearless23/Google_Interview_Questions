# Print all Jumping Numbers smaller than or equal to a given value

A number is called as a Jumping Number if all adjacent digits in it differ by 1. The difference between ‘9’ and ‘0’ is not considered as 1.
All single digit numbers are considered as Jumping Numbers. For example 7, 8987 and 4343456 are Jumping numbers but 796 and 89098 are not.

Given a positive number x, print all Jumping Numbers smaller than or equal to x. The numbers can be printed in any order.

[Solution](./q10.js)

Example:

```txt
Input: x = 20
Output:  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 12

Input: x = 105
Output:  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 12
         21 23 32 34 43 45 54 56 65
         67 76 78 87 89 98 101

Note: Order of output doesn't matter,
i.e. numbers can be printed in any order
```

### My Approach 1

Loop from 0 to Num, check each if valid Jumping Num.

### My Approach 2

Construct Jumping Numbers

Digits = 1:
- All

Digits = 2:
- First Digit = 1, so second digit = 2
- First Digit = 2, so second Digit = 1,3
- First Digit = 3, so second Digit = 2,4
- ...
- First Digit = 9, so second Digit = 8

Digits = 3:
- First Digit = 1, so Second Digit 0,2, Third Digit 0 - 1, 2 - 1,3
 i.e 101,121, 123

Can be done recursively..
??: It generates numbers recursively, but to limit is little tricky
Like for 105: we create 
all 1d nums, 
all 2d nums
3d with 1 only and with limits


### My Approach 3:
Given a jumping number starting from 10 find next.
Start from second last digit, check possible next Vals 
- If last digit is not max, then make it next max and that will be next JumpingNum
- If last digit is max, move 1pos back and then compare.
