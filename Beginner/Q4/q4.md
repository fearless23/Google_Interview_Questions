# Find largest word in dictionary by deleting some characters of given string

Giving a dictionary and a string ‘str’, find the longest string in dictionary
which can be formed by deleting some characters of the given ‘str’.

[Solution](./q4.js)

Example 1:

```txt
Input : dict = {"ale", "apple", "monkey", "plea"}
str = "abpcplea"
Output : apple
```

Example 2:

```txt
Input : dict = {"pintu", "geeksfor", "geeksgeeks"," forgeek"}
str = "geeksforgeeks"
Output : geeksgeeks
```

# My Approach 1

- Make substrings of length l = largest word in dict
  by deleting random chars. (`?? Deleting 4 chars can be a tedious task...nc4 loops..`)
- Check if any substring match
- Repeat step 1 with second largest word in dict and repeat.

# My Approach 2

Step 1:

- Get largest word in dict
- Loop over its chars... "monkey" --> m,o,n,k,e,y
- Find `m` in `str` if found, split `str` at `m` to `remStr`
- Find `o` in `remStr`, if found further `split`
- Find `n` in `remStr`, if not found return `Not found`

Repeat with second largest and so on; only if earlier word was not found
