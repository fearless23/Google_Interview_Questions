# Find the longest substring with k unique characters in a given string

Given a string you need to print longest possible substring that has exactly M unique characters. If there are more than one substring of longest possible length, then print any one of them.

[Solution](./q6.js)

Example 1:

```
"aabbcc", k = 1
Max substring can be any one from {"aa" , "bb" , "cc"}.
```

Example 2:

```
"aabbcc", k = 2
Max substring can be any one from {"aabb" , "bbcc"}.
```

Example 3:

```
"aabbcc", k = 3
There are substrings with exactly 3 unique characters
{"aabbcc" , "abbcc" , "aabbc" , "abbc" }
Max is "aabbcc" with length 6.
```

Example 4:

```
"aaabbb", k = 3
There are only two unique characters, thus show error message.
```
