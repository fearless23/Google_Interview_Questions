# Sudoku | Backtracking-7

Given a partially filled 9×9 2D array ‘grid[9][9]’, the goal is to assign digits (from 1 to 9) to the empty cells so that every row, column, and subgrid of size 3×3 contains exactly one instance of the digits from 1 to 9.

## My Approach 1
Loop over 2D Array
For any empty cell: Find existing filled values in that row, column and 3x3 grid
Those values are not allowed, keepTrack of possible values that can be filled.

If a emptyCell is found to have single Possible value, fill it.

Loop over array again: This time you have lesser empty cells.
